            <p>My name is Aaron Topping. I have been married for 15 years (since 2009), have 3 daughters, and I love to code! I have been programming as a hobby for many years, but it was only after the success and popularity of my most popular program that I was encouraged by others that I should try to make a career out of it. So, here I am - A little older than the average college student, but completely determined to make this work out. I look forward to all that I will learn, both on the front end, the back end, and all of the gritty stuff inbetween.</p>

            <p>Arizona is a state in the Southewest region of the USA. It shares a border with California on West, and Mexico on the bottom, New Mexico at the East, and Utah at the North. We are most known for The Grand Canyon, amzing outdoor camping and hiking destinations at our National Parks, as well as the famous Sonoran Desert featuring the tall Saguaro cacti.
